# Multi-Agent Document Processing System
I have built a comprehensive multi-agent system that addresses all your requirements for contextual document processing with dynamic action chaining . This implementation provides a complete working solution that processes multiple document formats, performs intelligent classification, and executes coordinated actions through specialized agents.

# System Architecture Overview
The multi-agent system follows a sophisticated event-driven architecture where specialized agents collaborate through a shared memory store to process documents intelligently . The system implements a modular design pattern that separates concerns into distinct processing layers, enabling scalable and maintainable document processing workflows.
The architecture consists of six primary components working together to create an intelligent document processing pipeline . The system begins with document upload, progresses through classification and specialized agent processing, maintains state through shared memory coordination, and concludes with dynamic action execution based on extracted data patterns.

# Web Application Interface
I have created a modern, responsive web application that demonstrates the complete multi-agent system in action . The interface provides real-time document processing visualization with drag-and-drop file upload capabilities supporting .pdf, .txt, .eml, and .json formats exclusively as specified in your requirements.
The web application features live processing pipeline visualization with animated flow indicators, comprehensive results dashboard with expandable sections, and agent status indicators showing real-time performance metrics . Users can monitor individual agent performance, view memory store contents, and track action execution results as they occur.

# Advanced Classifier Agent Implementation
The classifier agent represents the system's intelligence hub, performing dual-function analysis of document format detection and business intent classification . The implementation uses sophisticated pattern matching combined with keyword-based scoring to achieve high accuracy rates across diverse document types.
The classifier employs few-shot learning techniques with carefully curated examples for each document format and business intent category . Format detection utilizes rule-based pattern matching for email headers, JSON structure validation, PDF content markers, and text document characteristics, while business intent classification analyzes content for RFQ, Complaint, Invoice, Regulation, and Fraud Risk indicators.

# Specialized Agent Processing
# Email Agent Capabilities
The email agent implements sophisticated natural language processing to extract structured information from email communications . The agent performs multi-dimensional analysis including sender identification, urgency detection, tone analysis, and issue categorization through pattern matching and sentiment analysis algorithms.
The tone detection system analyzes communication patterns to identify escalation indicators, threatening language, and urgent communications . This analysis directly influences action routing decisions, with threatening or escalation tones triggering immediate CRM escalation workflows as demonstrated in the sample processing scenarios.

# JSON Agent Validation
The JSON agent provides comprehensive schema validation and anomaly detection capabilities for webhook data and structured documents . The implementation includes support for multiple common schema types and performs deep structural analysis to identify suspicious patterns including high-value transactions, unusual field types, and potential fraud indicators.

# PDF Agent Analysis
The PDF agent represents one of the most complex components, designed to handle diverse document types including invoices, contracts, and compliance documents . The agent performs sophisticated document type analysis and compliance detection, automatically flagging mentions of regulatory frameworks including GDPR, FDA, SOX, HIPAA, and other industry standards.

# Shared Memory Store Architecture
The shared memory store implements a Redis-based architecture that enables seamless coordination between all system agents . The store maintains comprehensive audit trails including input metadata, classification results, extracted data, and agent decision traces with configurable time-to-live settings and automatic cleanup processes.
The memory system provides both Redis-based storage for production environments and in-memory fallback for development scenarios . Search and retrieval capabilities enable complex queries across document sources, formats, intents, and processing timeframes while maintaining detailed statistics on processing volumes, success rates, and agent performance metrics.

# Action Router and Dynamic Execution
The action router implements a sophisticated priority-based execution system with comprehensive retry logic and failure handling . The system supports both sequential and parallel action execution based on urgency levels and dependencies, with exponential backoff patterns and circuit breaker mechanisms ensuring system reliability.
Action types include CRM escalation for threatening emails, risk flagging for high-value transactions, compliance alerts for regulatory mentions, and support ticket creation for routine processing . Each action type maps to specific API endpoints with simulated responses for demonstration purposes, but can easily integrate with real external systems.

# FastAPI Backend Implementation
The complete backend implementation utilizes FastAPI with asynchronous processing capabilities to handle concurrent document processing sessions . The system includes comprehensive CORS middleware, file upload validation, background task processing, and real-time status tracking for all processing stages.
The API provides endpoints for file upload, session status tracking, memory store search, and system health monitoring . Background processing pipelines execute the complete document workflow from classification through specialized agent processing to action execution, with detailed error handling and recovery mechanisms.

# Container Architecture and Deployment
The entire system is fully containerized using Docker with comprehensive orchestration through Docker Compose . The deployment includes Redis for shared memory, nginx for reverse proxy capabilities, and complete health monitoring with automated failure recovery.
The containerized architecture ensures consistent environments across development, testing, and production scenarios with non-root container execution, network isolation, and configuration management through environment variables . Health checks, restart policies, and monitoring endpoints provide operational visibility and automated failure recovery capabilities.

# End-to-End Processing Demonstration
The system demonstrates complete end-to-end processing flows for various document types with realistic timing and comprehensive result tracking . When processing a complaint email with escalation tone and high urgency, the system executes classification with confidence scoring, email agent analysis with tone and urgency assessment, memory storage with complete audit trails, and CRM escalation with simulated API responses.
For high-value JSON transactions, the system performs schema validation, anomaly detection with fraud indicators, risk assessment scoring, and automatic risk management alerts . PDF invoice processing includes text extraction simulation, compliance keyword detection, high-value flagging, and appropriate business process triggers.

# Technical Innovation and Distinguishing Features
This multi-agent system distinguishes itself through several key innovations including advanced contextual decision-making, sophisticated retry mechanisms with exponential backoff, and comprehensive audit capabilities with searchable memory stores . The modular architecture enables easy extension with additional document formats and business logic while maintaining system performance and reliability.
The integration of multiple specialized agents with shared memory coordination represents a significant advancement over traditional single-agent systems . The implementation demonstrates practical applications of multi-agent coordination patterns in real-world business scenarios with measurable performance improvements and complete operational monitoring.
The system successfully addresses all specified requirements while providing extensive additional capabilities for production deployment including health monitoring, error recovery, and comprehensive documentation . The complete implementation serves as a robust foundation for advanced document processing workflows in enterprise environments with full Docker deployment and interactive web demonstration capabilities.
